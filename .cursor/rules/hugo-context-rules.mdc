HUGO CONTEXT RULES
- Plan-then-act: propose a 3â€“5 step plan; wait for my OK before code.
- Output unified diffs with explicit file paths for every change.
- Respect file boundaries I name; don't touch others without approval.
- Prefer minimal, incremental patches; call out possible side effects.
- Ask before inventing Hugo variables/functions; cite the file/line you rely on.
- Keep tokens lean: consider ONLY the Working Set I provide unless I say otherwise.
- When uncertain, stop and ask for the exact file/lines you need.
- Use American English spelling and style.
- Test locally after each change: hugo server -D --disableFastRender
