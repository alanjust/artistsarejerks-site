      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI and Algorithmic Art has existed for many decades, predating popular and widespread availability and usage. Artists in the field work with engineers and computer scientists to code the algorithms, and train the models. Key figures include Refik Anadol, Anna Ridler, and Mario Klingemann. The practice raises conceptual and philosophical questions regarding the nature of art, AI, human/machine interactions, and the future of visual aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Appropriation Art (Readymade?) gained prominence in the 1980s, although its roots can be traced back to earlier movements like Dada and Pop Art.

Conceptual artists often challenge traditional notions of art authorship, skill, and the art market, focusing on the intellectual and theoretical aspects of art-making.TBD&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Emerging in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Land Art involved creating art directly in the landscape, sculpting the land itself or making structures with natural materials like rocks, soil, and water. Often monumental in scale, these works are frequently located in remote areas, subject to natural processes of erosion and decay.

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/movements/minimalism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Minimalism emerged in the 1960s as a reaction against the emotionalism of Abstract Expressionism. It emphasized simplicity, objectivity, and the viewer&amp;rsquo;s experience of the artwork in space. Minimalist works often consist of simple geometric forms, repeated units, and industrially produced materials like steel, concrete, and fluorescent lights. Key figures include Donald Judd, Sol LeWitt, and Dan Flavin. The focus is on the physical presence of the object and its relationship to the surrounding environment, rather than any symbolic or emotional meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/movements/neo-expressionism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Neo-Expressionism was a reaction against the conceptual and minimalist art of the 1970s. It revived figuration, expressive brushwork, and intense colors, often drawing on historical and mythological themes. Artists sought to convey raw emotion and personal narratives, rejecting the cool detachment of much contemporary art. Key figures include: Julian Schnabel, Georg Baselitz, and Anselm Kiefer. The movement was international in scope and marked a return to more traditional art-making practices, albeit with a postmodern sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Photorealism developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a reaction against Abstract Expressionism and Minimalism. Artists meticulously reproduce photographic images on canvas, often using projectors or grids to transfer the image. The subject matter is typically everyday scenes and objects, rendered with a high degree of technical skill and precision. Key figures include: Chuck Close, Richard Estes, and Audrey Flack. Photorealism highlights the relationship between painting and photography, and questions the nature of perception and representation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pop Art challenged traditional fine art by incorporating imagery from advertising, comic books, and mundane cultural objects. It often used bold colors, mechanical reproduction techniques like screen printing, and a sense of irony or celebration of consumer culture. Key figures include Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and Claes Oldenburg. The movement aimed to blur the lines between &amp;ldquo;high&amp;rdquo; art and &amp;ldquo;low&amp;rdquo; culture, reflecting the growing influence of mass media and consumerism on society.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Post-Internet Art doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean art made on the internet, but rather art that is deeply influenced by the internet&amp;rsquo;s existence and its effects on culture. It often addresses themes of connectivity, information overload, digital identity, and the blurring of online and offline experiences. It can take many forms, including physical objects, installations, videos, and online platforms. Key figures include: Petra Cortright, Ryan Trecartin, and Hito Steyerl.

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/movements/postminimalism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Postminimalism retains Minimalism&amp;rsquo;s interest in simple forms and industrial materials, but often introduces elements of process, chance, and organic materials. It tends to be more personal and expressive than Minimalism, embracing sensuality, and imperfections. Key figures include: Eva Hesse, Richard Serra, and Bruce Nauman. Postminimalist works often explore the body, the effects of gravity, and the passage of time, emphasizing the physicality of materials and the process of art-making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coined by curator Nicolas Bourriaud in the 1990s, Relational Aesthetics describes art that takes as its starting point the whole of human relations and their social context, rather than an independent and private space.

They often explored themes of death, identity, consumerism, and the media, often with a dark sense of humor. Key figures include: Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, and Sarah Lucas. The YBAs revitalized the British art scene and gained international recognition, but also attracted controversy for their sometimes sensationalist approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
