# Artist Studio Guide

## What Really Happens in an Artist's Studio

Forget the romantic myths. Here's what actually goes on when artists make art.

### Studio Types
- **The Chaos Generator** - Where mess equals creativity (or does it?)
- **The Factory Floor** - Systematic, process-driven spaces 
- **The Thinking Chamber** - More contemplation than creation
- **The Performance Stage** - Studios designed to be seen

### Daily Routines
- Morning rituals that actually matter
- The myth of inspiration vs. the reality of showing up
- How artists deal with creative blocks (spoiler: badly)

### Tools & Materials
- What artists actually spend money on
- The difference between amateur and professional setups
- Why expensive doesn't always mean better

### Studio Visits
- How to look at work-in-progress 
- What questions to ask (and not ask)
- Reading the room: studio etiquette
