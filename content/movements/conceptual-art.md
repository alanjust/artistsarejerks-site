Conceptual Art emerged in the mid-1960s and emphasizes that the concept or idea behind the artwork is more important than the finished physical object, if one even exists. It can take many forms, including text, documentation, performances, and found objects. Key figures include Sol LeWitt, Joseph Kosuth, and Lawrence Weiner. Conceptual artists often challenge traditional notions of art authorship, skill, and the art market, focusing on the intellectual and theoretical aspects of art-making.TBD
