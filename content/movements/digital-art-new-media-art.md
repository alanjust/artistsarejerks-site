Emerging with the development of computer technology, Digital Art and New Media Art include a wide range of practices, such as computer graphics, animation, virtual reality, interactive installations, and net art. These works often explore the possibilities and implications of technology, its impact on society, and its relationship to traditional art forms. Key figures include Nam June Paik, Lynn Hershman Leeson, and Olafur Eliasson (who often incorporates digital elements). This field is constantly evolving as new technologies emerge.
