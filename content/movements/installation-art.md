Installation Art gained prominence in the 1970s, though its origins can be traced back to earlier practices. It involves creating large-scale, mixed-media constructions, often designed for a specific site and intended to be experienced as a total environment. Installation artworks can be temporary or permanent, indoors or outdoors, and often incorporate a variety of materials and sensory experiences. Key figures include Yayoi Kusama, Christo and Jeanne-Claude, and James Turrell. The emphasis is on the viewer's interaction with the artwork and the transformed space.
