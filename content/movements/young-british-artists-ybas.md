The YBAs gained notoriety in the 1990s for their use of unconventional materials, provocative imagery, and a "shock of the new" approach. They often explored themes of death, identity, consumerism, and the media, often with a dark sense of humor. Key figures include: Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, and Sarah Lucas. The YBAs revitalized the British art scene and gained international recognition, but also attracted controversy for their sometimes sensationalist approach.
