Social Practice Art emphasizes collaboration, participation, and social engagement as integral aspects of the artwork. It often takes place in the public sphere and addresses social and political issues, aiming to create positive change or raise awareness. Projects can involve workshops, community organizing, interventions, and other forms of direct action. Key figures include: Tania Bruguera, Theaster Gates, and Rick Lowe. The focus is on the process and the impact of the art on individuals and communities, rather than on the creation of a traditional art object.
