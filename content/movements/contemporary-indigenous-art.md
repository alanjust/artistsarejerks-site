Contemporary Indigenous Art is not a single style, but rather a broad category encompassing the work of artists from Indigenous communities around the world. It often addresses issues of identity, cultural heritage, colonialism, and the environment, while engaging with contemporary art discourses. It can include painting, sculpture, performance, video, and other media. Key figures vary widely by region and cultural background. This art plays a vital role in maintaining and revitalizing Indigenous cultures, while also challenging dominant narratives and promoting cross-cultural understanding.
