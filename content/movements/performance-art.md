Performance Art emerged as a significant art form in the 1960s, though it has roots in earlier avant-garde movements. It involves live actions presented to an audience, often challenging conventional art forms and incorporating elements of theater, dance, music, and visual art. The artist's body is often the central medium, and the work can be spontaneous or scripted, ephemeral or enduring through documentation. Key figures include Marina Abramović, Chris Burden, and Yoko Ono. Performance art frequently addresses issues of the body, identity, social critique, and the nature of art itself.
