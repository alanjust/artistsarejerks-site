Minimalism emerged in the 1960s as a reaction against the emotionalism of Abstract Expressionism. It emphasized simplicity, objectivity, and the viewer's experience of the artwork in space. Minimalist works often consist of simple geometric forms, repeated units, and industrially produced materials like steel, concrete, and fluorescent lights. Key figures include Donald Judd, Sol LeWitt, and Dan Flavin. The focus is on the physical presence of the object and its relationship to the surrounding environment, rather than any symbolic or emotional meaning.
