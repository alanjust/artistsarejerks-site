AI and Algorithmic Art has existed for many decades, predating popular and widespread availability and usage. Artists in the field work with engineers and computer scientists to code the algorithms, and train the models. Key figures include Refik Anadol, Anna Ridler, and Mario Klingemann. The practice raises conceptual and philosophical questions regarding the nature of art, AI, human/machine interactions, and the future of visual aesthetics.
