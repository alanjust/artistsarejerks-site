Postminimalism retains Minimalism's interest in simple forms and industrial materials, but often introduces elements of process, chance, and organic materials. It tends to be more personal and expressive than Minimalism, embracing sensuality, and imperfections. Key figures include: Eva Hesse, Richard Serra, and Bruce Nauman. Postminimalist works often explore the body, the effects of gravity, and the passage of time, emphasizing the physicality of materials and the process of art-making.
