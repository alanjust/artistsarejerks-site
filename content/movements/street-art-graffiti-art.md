Emerging from graffiti subcultures in the 1970s and 1980s, Street Art encompasses a wide range of styles and techniques, including spray paint, stencils, wheatpasting, and murals. It often carries social or political messages, and can be a form of artistic expression, commentary, or protest. Key figures include: Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, and Banksy. Street Art challenges traditional notions of art ownership and the gallery system, engaging directly with the public in urban environments.
