Pop Art challenged traditional fine art by incorporating imagery from advertising, comic books, and mundane cultural objects. It often used bold colors, mechanical reproduction techniques like screen printing, and a sense of irony or celebration of consumer culture. Key figures include Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and Claes Oldenburg. The movement aimed to blur the lines between "high" art and "low" culture, reflecting the growing influence of mass media and consumerism on society.
