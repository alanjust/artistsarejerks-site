Appropriation Art (Readymade?) gained prominence in the 1980s, although its roots can be traced back to earlier movements like Dada and Pop Art. Artists deliberately recontextualize or copy existing images and objects, raising questions about originality, authorship, and the nature of art in a media-saturated culture. Key figures include Sherrie Levine, Richard Prince, and Jeff Koons. Appropriation Art often critiques consumerism, mass media, and the art market itself, prompting viewers to reconsider the meaning and value of cultural artifacts.
