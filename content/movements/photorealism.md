Photorealism developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a reaction against Abstract Expressionism and Minimalism. Artists meticulously reproduce photographic images on canvas, often using projectors or grids to transfer the image. The subject matter is typically everyday scenes and objects, rendered with a high degree of technical skill and precision. Key figures include: Chuck Close, Richard Estes, and Audrey Flack. Photorealism highlights the relationship between painting and photography, and questions the nature of perception and representation.
