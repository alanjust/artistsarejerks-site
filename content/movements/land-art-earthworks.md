Emerging in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Land Art involved creating art directly in the landscape, sculpting the land itself or making structures with natural materials like rocks, soil, and water. Often monumental in scale, these works are frequently located in remote areas, subject to natural processes of erosion and decay. Key figures include: Robert Smithson, Walter De Maria, and Nancy Holt. Land Art sought to escape the confines of the gallery and engage with the environment in a direct and powerful way, raising questions about art's relationship to nature, time, and permanence.
