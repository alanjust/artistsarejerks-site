Emerging in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Bio Art involves working with live bacteria, plants, animals, or human tissues, often in a laboratory setting. It raises ethical questions about the manipulation of life, the relationship between art and science, and the boundaries of the natural world. Key figures include Eduardo Kac, Marta de Menezes, and Stelarc. Bio Art often collaborates with scientists and explores the implications of biotechnology and genetic engineering.
