- How exhibitions get made
- The politics of museum boards
- Why some art gets collected and other work disappears

- How artists get "discovered"
- The myth of the starving artist

**Art Critics**
- Who still reads art criticism?
- The power of a bad review
- How taste gets manufactured
- Critics vs. influencers: the changing landscape

**Art Fair Directors**
- The trade show-ification of art
- Miami Basel and the circus economy  
- How fairs shape what gets made

### The Outer Ring

**Collectors**
- Private collectors vs. institutions
- What drives art investment
- The psychology of collecting
- When passion meets portfolio management

**Art Educators**
- How art history gets written
- Academic vs. market validation
- The role of MFA programs
- Alternative education models

### Breaking Through the Gates
- Artists who succeeded without traditional gatekeeping
