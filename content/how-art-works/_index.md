# How Art Works

## The Science of the Aesthetic Break

Why do you spend 27 seconds looking at most art, but sometimes stop dead in your tracks and can't look away?

### What Happens in Your Brain
- **The Prediction Machine** - How your brain processes visual information
- **Pattern Recognition** - Why some compositions feel "right"
- **The Aesthetic Break** - When expectation meets surprise
- **Default Mode Network** - Why good art quiets mental chatter

### Three Types of Art Experience

**Decoration**
- Confirms what you already find pleasant
- Background music for your eyes  
- Nothing wrong with it, just not transformative

**Spectacle** 
- Grabs attention through scale or sensory overload
- Impressive in the moment, forgotten by morning
- The art world equivalent of fireworks

**Meaning-Making Art**
- Creates productive trouble in your perception
- Makes familiar things strange, strange things familiar
- Leaves you slightly different than when you arrived

### Active Looking vs. Passive Consuming
- Why some art requires participation
- The difference between "getting it" and experiencing it
- Training your attention in a distracted world

### The Role of Context
- How museums shape perception
- Why location matters 
- The power (and problems) of art world gatekeeping

**Coming Soon:**
- Interactive perception tests
- Neuroaesthetic case studies
- "Slow Looking" guided exercises
- Artist interviews on intention vs. interpretation
