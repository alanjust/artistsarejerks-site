# What's a Jerk?

Every artist is difficult in some way. The only question is: are they a **good jerk** or a **bad jerk**?

## Coming Soon: The Interactive Jerk Wheel

This page will feature the main interactive wheel that splits artists into:

- **Good Jerks** (Left Half) - Artists who are difficult because they care too much about transformation
- **Bad Jerks** (Right Half) - Artists who are difficult because they care too little about anyone but themselves  
- **Normie Artists** (Bottom Toggle) - Artists who are just genuinely nice people

*This section is currently in development. The wheel interface and artist profiles will be added in the next phase.*
