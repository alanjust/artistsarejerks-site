## Notable Artwork: Machine Hallucinations (various)

Machine Hallucinations is a series of immersive audiovisual installations that use AI to process large datasets of images (e.g., photographs of New York City, space imagery) and generate mesmerizing, dreamlike visualizations. The AI "hallucinates" patterns and forms based on the data it has been trained on.

### Significance

Anadol's work explores the intersection of human perception, data, and machine intelligence. Machine Hallucinations transforms vast amounts of data into captivating aesthetic experiences, prompting reflection on the nature of memory, perception, and the potential of AI to create new forms of visual expression.
