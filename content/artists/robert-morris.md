## Notable Artwork: Untitled (1967-1968) from his "Felt Pieces" series.

This piece is part of a larger work featuring large pieces of industrial felt that are cut and hung from the wall or piled on the floor. They are arranged, not according to a fixed design, but dictated, at least in part, by gravity and the properties of the material itself.

### Significance

This, with his Anti-Form manifesto, launched what has come to be termed Post-Minimalism. Morris's work embraced indeterminacy and chance, a move away from Minimalism's rigid forms.
