## Notable Artwork: Spiral Jetty (1970)

Spiral Jetty is a 1,500-foot-long, 15-foot-wide coil of black basalt rocks and earth extending into the Great Salt Lake in Utah. The work is subject to the changing water levels of the lake, sometimes being submerged and sometimes emerging.

### Significance

Spiral Jetty is arguably the most famous work of Land Art. It is a monumental example of human intervention in the landscape, but it is also an artwork that is constantly being transformed by natural processes. It embodies themes of entropy, time, and the relationship between humans and nature.
