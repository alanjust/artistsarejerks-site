## Notable Artwork: Dorchester Projects (2006-ongoing)

Dorchester Projects is an ongoing urban revitalization project in Chicago's South Side. Gates transformed a series of abandoned buildings into community spaces, including a library, a performance venue, and an archive. The project uses reclaimed materials and involves local residents in the process.

### Significance

This work is a landmark example of Social Practice, demonstrating how art can be a catalyst for social change and community development. Gates combines artistic practice with urban planning, historic preservation, and community organizing.
