## Notable Artwork: Au Naturel (1994)

This work is a sculpture consisting of a mattress, a bucket, a pair of melons, a cucumber, and two oranges, arranged to suggest a couple engaged in sexual activity.

### Significance

Lucas's work often uses everyday objects and crude humor to explore themes of sex, gender, and the body. Au Naturel is a witty and provocative piece that challenges traditional representations of sexuality and subverts the male gaze.
