Immigrant Movement International was a long-term project in Queens, New York, that created a community center and platform for immigrant advocacy. The project involved workshops, legal services, and artistic interventions, focusing on empowering immigrant communities.

Bruguera's work often addresses political and social issues, particularly those related to immigration, power, and freedom of expression. Immigrant Movement International exemplifies her concept of "arte Ãºtil" (useful art), which emphasizes the practical application of art to address real-world problems.
