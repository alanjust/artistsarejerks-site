## Notable Artwork: Latentscapes #6, 2018 Collaborations with the Artificial Self

Sarin uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create landscapes that do not exist. The AI generates realistic but entirely fictional places, based on its training on a vast dataset of real landscapes.

### Significance

Collaborations with the Artificial Self raises questions about the nature of identity, representation, and the relationship between reality and simulation. The work explores the potential of AI to create convincing but ultimately artificial representations of place, blurring the lines between the real and the virtual.
