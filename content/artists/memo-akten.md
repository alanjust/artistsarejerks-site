## Notable Artwork: Learning to See (2017)

Learning to See is a series of interactive installations that use neural networks to "see" and interpret the world. The AI is trained on specific datasets (e.g., images of clouds, flowers, or flames) and then "projects" its understanding onto real-time video input, creating abstract and often surprising visualizations.

### Significance

Akten's work explores the ways in which machines learn and perceive the world, and how this differs from human perception. Learning to See makes the invisible processes of machine learning visible, prompting reflection on the nature of intelligence, perception, and the biases inherent in AI systems.
