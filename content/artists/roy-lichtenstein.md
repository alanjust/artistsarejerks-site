## Notable Artwork: Whaam! (1963)

This large-scale diptych painting depicts a fighter jet firing a missile at another plane, with the explosion rendered in bold, graphic style. Lichtenstein appropriated the imagery from a comic book panel, using his signature Ben-Day dots to mimic the look of commercial printing.

### Significance

Whaam! exemplifies Lichtenstein's use of comic book imagery and his adaptation of commercial printing techniques to create high art. The painting's dramatic subject matter and bold style capture the energy and visual language of popular culture.
