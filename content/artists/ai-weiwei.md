## Notable Artwork: Sunflower Seeds (2010)

This installation at Tate Modern's Turbine Hall consisted of millions of handcrafted porcelain sunflower seeds, spread across the floor of the vast space. Visitors were initially allowed to walk on and interact with the seeds.

### Significance

Sunflower Seeds is a powerful work that addresses themes of mass production, individuality, and Chinese culture. The sheer scale of the installation and the labor-intensive process of creating each individual seed highlight the tension between the individual and the collective. The work also has political undertones, referencing the Cultural Revolution in China.
