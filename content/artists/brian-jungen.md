## Notable Artwork: Prototype for New Understanding #1 (1998)

This is part of a series of sculptures in which Jungen disassembled Nike Air Jordan sneakers and reassembled them into forms resembling Northwest Coast Indigenous masks.

### Significance

Jungen's work often uses mass-produced consumer goods to explore themes of cultural appropriation, globalization, and Indigenous identity. The Prototype series cleverly juxtaposes the iconic imagery of a global brand with traditional Indigenous forms, prompting reflection on cultural exchange and commodification.
