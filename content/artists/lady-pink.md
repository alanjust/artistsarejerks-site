Lady Pink (Sandra Fabara) was one of the few women active in the early New York City graffiti scene. She is known for her large-scale murals on subway trains, often featuring bold lettering, female characters, and themes of female empowerment.

### Significance

Lady Pink is a pioneering figure in graffiti art, breaking barriers in a male-dominated subculture. Her work on subway trains, a highly visible and contested space, made a powerful statement about female presence and artistic expression. She helped pave the way for other women in the street art world.
