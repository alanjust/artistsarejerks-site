## About Georg Baselitz

Born: January 23, 1938, Deutschbaselitz, Germany Nationality: German Style: Neo-Expressionism Influences: German Expressionism, Art Brut, African sculpture Major Exhibitions: "Adler (Eagle)" (1977), "The Heroes" (1965-66), "Die grossen Freunde" (1965) Quote: "I wanted to paint pictures that were not about something, but were something themselves."

## Notable Artwork: Adler (Eagle) (1977)

Baselitz is known for his inverted figures. Adler depicts an eagle painted upside down, rendered in thick, gestural brushstrokes.

### Significance

Baselitz's inverted figures are a signature element of his style. By inverting the image, he disrupts traditional modes of representation and forces the viewer to see the painting in a new way. Adler, a symbol of German national identity, presented upside down, can be interpreted as a commentary on German history and identity.
