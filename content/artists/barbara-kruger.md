## Notable Artwork: Untitled (Your body is a battleground) (1989)

This work combines a black-and-white photograph of a woman's face, divided down the middle, with the bold text "Your body is a battleground" overlaid in white Futura Bold Oblique font on a red background.

### Significance

Kruger's work is known for its powerful use of text and image to address issues of power, gender, consumerism, and identity. Untitled (Your body is a battleground) was created for a pro-choice march on Washington, and it has become an iconic image of feminist art and activism. While she appropriates the style of mass-media advertising, she subverts its message.
