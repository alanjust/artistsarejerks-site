## Notable Artwork: Interior Scroll (1975)

In this performance, Schneemann stood nude, read from a text she had written, and then slowly pulled a narrow scroll from her vagina, reading from it as it emerged.

### Significance

Interior Scroll is a seminal work of feminist performance art. It challenges patriarchal notions of art and the female body, reclaiming the female body as a site of knowledge and creative power. It is a bold and confrontational work that addresses issues of gender, sexuality, and artistic expression.
