## About Marta de Menezes

Born: 1975, Lisbon, Portugal Nationality: Portuguese Style: Bio Art Influences: Biology, genetics, ethics Major Exhibitions: "Nature?" (1999-2000), "NucleArt" (2002), "The Origin of Species" (2008) Quote: "I'm interested in the ethical and philosophical implications of biotechnology." Website: http://martademenezes.com/

## Notable Artwork: Nature? (1999-2000)

Nature? involves modifying the wing patterns of living butterflies. De Menezes uses micro-cautery on butterfly pupae to alter the development of the wings, creating unique, non-natural designs. The butterflies live out their normal lifespan.

### Significance

This project directly intervenes in a living organism's development to create a living artwork. It questions the boundaries between natural and artificial, challenging our understanding of what constitutes "nature" and raising ethical questions about manipulating living beings for aesthetic purposes.
