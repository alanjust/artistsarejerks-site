## About Marina Abramović

Born: November 30, 1946, Belgrade, Serbia Nationality: Serbian Style: Performance Art, Body Art, Endurance Art Influences: Conceptual Art, Feminist Art, Eastern European performance traditions Major Exhibitions: "Rhythm 0" (1974), "Relation in Time" (1977), "The Artist Is Present" (2010) Quote: "An artist should avoid falling in love with another artist."

## Notable Artwork: Rhythm 0 (1974)

In this six-hour performance, Abramović stood passively in a gallery while the audience was invited to interact with her using any of 72 objects placed on a table, ranging from a rose to a loaded gun. The performance explored themes of vulnerability, power, and the limits of human behavior.

### Significance

Rhythm 0 is a powerful and disturbing exploration of the relationship between the artist and the audience, and the potential for both violence and passivity within that dynamic. It is a landmark work of endurance art and raises profound ethical questions.
