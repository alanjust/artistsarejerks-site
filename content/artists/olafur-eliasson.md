## Notable Artwork: The Weather Project (2003)

This large-scale installation at Tate Modern's Turbine Hall in London created an artificial sun using hundreds of monofrequency lamps, mirrors, and mist. Visitors could bask in the orange glow and see their silhouettes reflected in the ceiling mirror, creating a collective experience.

### Significance

The Weather Project is a powerful example of Eliasson's interest in natural phenomena, perception, and the creation of immersive environments. It transformed a vast industrial space into a sublime and contemplative experience, prompting reflection on our relationship with nature and the built environment.
