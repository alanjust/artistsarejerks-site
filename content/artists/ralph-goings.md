## Notable Artwork: McDonalds Pickup (1970)

Ralph Goings' "McDonald's Pickup" (1970) is a significant work in the American Photorealism movement that captures far more than just a vehicle in a fast-food parking lot. This painting exemplifies several important artistic and cultural developments of its time.This painting depicts the interior of a classic American diner, with meticulous attention to detail, capturing the shiny surfaces of the counter, stools, and fixtures.

### Significance

Goings was one of the pioneering figures of Photorealism, a movement that emerged in the late 1960s as a reaction against Abstract Expressionism and Minimalism. His meticulous technique in "McDonald's Pickup" demonstrates the photorealist commitment to creating paintings so precise they appear to be photographs. Goings's work often focuses on everyday scenes of American life, particularly diners, trucks, and fast-food restaurants.
