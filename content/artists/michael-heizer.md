## About Michael Heizer

Born: 1944, Berkeley, California, USA Nationality: American Style: Land Art, Earthworks, Environmental Art Influences: Prehistoric earthworks, American West landscapes, sublime Major Exhibitions: "Double Negative" (1969-70), "City" (1972-ongoing), "Levitated Mass" (2012) Quote: "I think size is the most underused quotient in the sculptor's repertoire."

## Notable Artwork: Double Negative (1969-70)

Double Negative consists of two large, aligned trenches cut into the edge of Mormon Mesa in Nevada. The work involved displacing 240,000 tons of rock, creating a negative space that is both monumental and subtly integrated into the landscape.

### Significance

Double Negative is a powerful example of Heizer's interest in creating large-scale, negative sculptures that redefine the landscape. It challenges traditional notions of sculpture as object, emphasizing instead the void and the relationship between the artwork and its environment.
