## Notable Artwork: The Islands (1961)

This is representative of a body of work comprised of large, square canvases covered with meticulously drawn grids, often in pale, muted colors. The grids are subtle and delicate, creating a sense of serenity and contemplation.

### Significance

While often associated with Minimalism, Martin's work also has a strong spiritual and emotional dimension. Her grids, while seemingly simple, are infused with a sense of subtle variation and human touch. They evoke a sense of tranquility and transcendence, distinguishing her work from the more impersonal, industrial aesthetic of some of her Minimalist contemporaries. Her work bridges Minimalism with Abstract Expressionism.
