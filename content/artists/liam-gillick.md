## Notable Artwork: Discussion Island: Projected Think Tank (1997)

This work consists of a platform or structure, often made of Plexiglas and aluminum, that serves as a designated space for conversation and discussion. The structure is often accompanied by texts or diagrams that relate to social and political issues.

### Significance

Gillick's work often explores the relationship between art, architecture, and social interaction. Discussion Island creates a physical and conceptual space for dialogue, reflecting Relational Aesthetics' emphasis on communication and exchange. It's less about the physical object and more about the potential for interaction it facilitates.
