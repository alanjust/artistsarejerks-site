## Notable Artwork: F-111 (1964-65)

This massive, room-sized painting combines fragmented images of a fighter jet, a girl under a hairdryer, a tire, spaghetti, and a mushroom cloud. The images are juxtaposed in a seemingly random, collage-like manner.

### Significance

F-111 is a powerful statement about the relationship between war, consumerism, and American culture. The fragmented imagery and overwhelming scale create a sense of sensory overload, reflecting the bombardment of images in modern life. The work is a critique of the military-industrial complex and the Vietnam War.
