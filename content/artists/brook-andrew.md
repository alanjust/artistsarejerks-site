## Notable Artwork: Jumping Castle War Memorial (2010)

This large-scale inflatable sculpture takes the form of a traditional Victorian-era memorial, but it is rendered in the bright colors and playful format of a children's jumping castle. The work incorporates Wiradjuri patterns.

### Significance

Andrew's work often addresses issues of colonialism, memory, and cultural identity in Australia. Jumping Castle War Memorial uses irony and juxtaposition to challenge traditional notions of commemoration and to highlight the often-overlooked Indigenous perspective on Australian history. It invites critical reflection on who and what is memorialized.
