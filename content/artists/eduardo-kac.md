GFP Bunny, also known as "Alba," is a genetically modified rabbit that glows fluorescent green under a specific blue light. Kac commissioned a French laboratory to create the rabbit using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene from a jellyfish.

### Significance

This work is arguably the most famous (and controversial) example of Bio Art. It sparked widespread debate about the ethical implications of genetic engineering, the commodification of life, and the role of the artist in scientific research. It brought Bio Art into the public consciousness.
