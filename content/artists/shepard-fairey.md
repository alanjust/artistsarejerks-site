## Notable Artwork: Obey Giant (various)

The Obey Giant campaign began with stickers featuring a stylized image of the wrestler Andre the Giant and the word "OBEY." Fairey expanded the campaign to include posters, stencils, and murals, spreading the image globally.

### Significance

Fairey's Obey Giant project is a seminal example of street art as a form of social and political commentary. It explores themes of propaganda, power, and the manipulation of public space. The campaign's ambiguous meaning encourages viewers to question authority and the messages they are bombarded with daily. His Hope poster of Barack Obama is another significant, related work.
