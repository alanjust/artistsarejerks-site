## About Richard Prince

## Notable Artwork: Untitled (Cowboy) (1989)

This work is a re-photograph of a Marlboro cigarette advertisement. Prince cropped the image to remove the text and branding, leaving only the image of the rugged cowboy.

### Significance

Untitled (Cowboy) is a classic example of Prince's appropriation of advertising imagery. By removing the commercial context, he highlights the constructed nature of these images and their role in shaping American mythology and masculinity. The work also raises questions about authorship and copyright.
