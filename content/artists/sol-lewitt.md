## About Sol LeWitt

Born: September 9, 1928, Hartford, Connecticut, USA Died: April 8, 2007, New York City, USA Nationality: American Style: Minimalism, Conceptual Art Influences: Geometry, seriality, systems Major Exhibitions: "Wall Drawings" series (1960s-2000s), "Paragraphs on Conceptual Art" (1967) Quote: "The idea becomes a machine that makes the art."

## Notable Artwork: Wall Drawing #118 (1971) (and his Wall Drawings generally, as well as his modular structures)

While also a key figure in Conceptual Art, LeWitt's Wall Drawings and modular structures have strong Minimalist characteristics. Wall Drawing #118, for example, consists of instructions for drawing straight lines between predetermined points on a wall. The resulting drawing is geometric and austere.

### Significance

Like his Conceptual works, LeWitt's Minimalist pieces emphasize the idea and the process over the artist's direct hand. The geometric forms and seriality align with Minimalist principles, even though the execution might be carried out by others.
