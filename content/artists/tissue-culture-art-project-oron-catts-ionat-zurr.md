## About Tissue Culture & Art Project (Oron Catts & Ionat Zurr)

Oron Catts: Born: 1967, Finland Ionat Zurr: Born: 1970, Israel Nationality: Australian (both) Style: Bio Art, Tissue Engineering Influences: Science, philosophy, ethics Major Exhibitions: "Victimless Leather" (2004), "The Pig Wings Project" (2000-2002), "Disembodied Cuisine" (2003) Quote: "We are interested in exploring the boundaries between life and non-life."

## Notable Artwork: Victimless Leather (2004)

Victimless Leather is a miniature, stitchless jacket grown from living mouse and human cells over a biodegradable polymer scaffold. The project explored the possibility of growing "semi-living" objects and questioned our relationship with leather as a material derived from animals.

### Significance

This project exemplifies the Tissue Culture &amp; Art Project's focus on "semi-living" entities and their exploration of the ethical and philosophical implications of tissue engineering. It challenges the notion of "victimless" consumption and raises questions about the future of manufacturing.
