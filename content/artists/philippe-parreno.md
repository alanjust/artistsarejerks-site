## Notable Artwork: No Ghost Just a Shell (2000-2002) (Collaboration with Pierre Huyghe)

Parreno and Huyghe purchased the rights to a generic anime character named Annlee. They then created a series of artworks using Annlee, giving her a voice and a story. The project explored issues of authorship, identity, and the virtual world.

### Significance

This collaborative project highlights the ways in which Relational Aesthetics can engage with virtual spaces and digital identities. It blurs the lines between fiction and reality, exploring the potential for collective creation and the construction of narratives.
