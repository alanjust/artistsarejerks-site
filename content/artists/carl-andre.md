## Notable Artwork: 144 Magnesium Square (1969)

This work consists of 144 identical square magnesium plates arranged in a grid on the floor. The work is meant to be walked on, emphasizing its physical presence and its relationship to the viewer's body.

### Significance

Andre's floor pieces are radical examples of Minimalist sculpture. They eliminate the pedestal, bringing the artwork down to the level of the viewer. They emphasize the materiality of the work and its interaction with the surrounding space. They challenge traditional notions of sculpture as something to be viewed from a distance.
