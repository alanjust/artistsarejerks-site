## Notable Artwork: Big Self-Portrait (1967-1968)

This large-scale, black-and-white painting depicts Close's face in extreme close-up, revealing every pore, wrinkle, and hair with astonishing detail. Close used a grid system to transfer the photographic image to the canvas, working systematically and meticulously.

### Significance

Big Self-Portrait is an iconic example of Photorealism. It demonstrates the technical virtuosity of the movement and its fascination with the photographic image. It also raises questions about portraiture, identity, and the relationship between painting and photography. While seemingly objective, the scale and detail create an almost unsettling effect.
