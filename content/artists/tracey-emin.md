## Notable Artwork: My Bed (1998)

This work is an installation consisting of Emin's own unmade bed, surrounded by personal items such as used condoms, cigarette butts, and empty vodka bottles. It is a raw and confessional piece that documents a period of depression and personal crisis in Emin's life.

### Significance

My Bed is a highly controversial work that challenges traditional notions of art and beauty. It is a deeply personal and intimate piece that blurs the lines between art and life. It sparked debate about the role of autobiography in art and the limits of artistic expression.
