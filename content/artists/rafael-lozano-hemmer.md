## Notable Artwork: Pulse Room (2006)

Pulse Room is an interactive installation that consists of hundreds of incandescent light bulbs suspended from the ceiling. The bulbs pulse with the heartbeats of visitors, who hold sensors that detect their pulse. The installation creates a collective, visceral experience of shared humanity.

### Significance

Lozano-Hemmer's work often uses technology to create large-scale, participatory installations that explore themes of connection, surveillance, and public space. Pulse Room transforms a vital sign (the heartbeat) into a visible and shared experience, creating a sense of intimacy and connection among strangers.
