## Notable Artwork: For Carl Andre (1970)

This work is one of a series of poured latex floor pieces. Benglis poured pigmented liquid latex directly onto the floor, allowing it to spread and solidify into organic, colorful shapes.

### Significance

For Carl Andre is a direct response to and critique of Minimalist sculpture (specifically Andre's floor pieces). Benglis's use of fluid, unpredictable materials and her emphasis on process and chance contrast sharply with the controlled geometry of Minimalism. The work is sensual, bodily, and celebrates the fluidity of form.
