## Notable Artwork: Super Mario Clouds (2002)

This work is a modified Nintendo Entertainment System cartridge that displays only the scrolling clouds from the original Super Mario Bros. video game. Arcangel hacked the game, removing all other elements, to create a minimalist, meditative experience.

### Significance

Super Mario Clouds is a classic example of "glitch art" and video game modification. It highlights the underlying code and structure of video games, transforming a familiar cultural artifact into something new and unexpected. It also comments on nostalgia, obsolescence, and the aesthetics of digital technology.
