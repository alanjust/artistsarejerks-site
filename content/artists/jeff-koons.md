## Notable Artwork: New Hoover Convertibles (1981-1987)

This from his series, The New, features pristine, unused vacuum cleaners displayed in fluorescent-lit, Plexiglas vitrines. The appliances are presented as objects of desire, elevated to the status of high art.

### Significance

While Koons is more commonly known for later work, The New series, including New Hoover Convertibles, exemplifies early 80's appropriation. The work reflects his interest in commodity culture, consumerism, and the blurring of lines between high art and everyday objects. He takes a readymade object and, by changing its context, transforms its meaning.
