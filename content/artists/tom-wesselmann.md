## Notable Artwork: Great American Nude #57 (1964)

This painting is part of a series of works depicting nude figures in flat, stylized interiors, often incorporating elements of collage (like actual objects or patterned wallpaper). The figures are often faceless and anonymous, emphasizing their status as objects of desire.

### Significance

Wesselmann's Great American Nude series explores themes of sexuality, consumerism, and the American dream. The paintings combine the visual language of advertising with the traditional genre of the nude, creating a uniquely Pop Art aesthetic. They reflect the changing sexual mores of the 1960s and the commodification of the female body.
