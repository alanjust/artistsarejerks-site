Schreibzeit is a massive, multi-part work consisting of handwritten sheets filled with numbers, dates, and other notations. Darboven developed complex systems for translating time into visual patterns, creating a visual representation of the passage of time.

### Significance

Darboven's work is characterized by its systematic, repetitive nature and its exploration of time, memory, and history. Schreibzeit is a monumental example of her process-based approach, emphasizing the durational aspect of art making and the accumulation of time and data.
