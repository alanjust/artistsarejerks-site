## Notable Artwork: Hang Up (1966)

Hang Up consists of a rectangular frame wrapped in cloth, with a long, flexible cord protruding from the top and extending onto the floor. The work combines hard and soft materials, geometric and organic forms, creating a sense of tension and ambiguity.

### Significance

Hang Up is a key transitional work between Minimalism and Postminimalism. It retains the geometric structure of Minimalism but introduces a sense of vulnerability, impermanence, and the body. Hesse's use of unconventional materials (cloth, cord) and her emphasis on process and tactility are characteristic of Postminimalism.
