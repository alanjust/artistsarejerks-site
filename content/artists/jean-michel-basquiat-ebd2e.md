## Notable Artwork: Hollywood Africans (1983)

This painting, while not strictly a "street" work, embodies the energy and style of Basquiat's graffiti roots (under the tag SAMOÂ©). It features a complex mix of text, figures, and symbols, addressing themes of race, identity, and the history of Black people in America.

### Significance

Basquiat's work bridged the gap between the street art scene and the established art world. Hollywood Africans, like much of his work, combines raw energy with sophisticated social commentary. His unique visual language incorporates elements of graffiti, Abstract Expressionism, and African art.
