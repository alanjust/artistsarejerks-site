## Notable Artwork: Radiant Baby (various)

The Radiant Baby, a crawling infant surrounded by lines radiating outward, was Haring's signature tag and became an iconic symbol of the 1980s New York street art scene. He drew it countless times in chalk on blank advertising panels in the subway system, as well as in paintings and other works.

### Significance

Haring's work, while rooted in the graffiti tradition, was also deeply influenced by Pop Art. The Radiant Baby is instantly recognizable and embodies Haring's optimistic and accessible style. His subway drawings brought art to a mass audience and helped legitimize street art as a valid art form.
