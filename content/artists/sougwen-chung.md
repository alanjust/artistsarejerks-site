## Notable Artwork: Drawing Operations Unit: Generation 1 (D.O.U.G.) (2015-ongoing)

This ongoing project involves a collaboration between Chung and a robotic arm (D.O.U.G.) that she has programmed to draw in response to her own movements. The two create drawings together in a real-time, improvisational performance.

### Significance

Chung's work explores the relationship between humans and machines, and the potential for collaboration and co-creation. Drawing Operations challenges traditional notions of authorship and explores the creative possibilities of human-machine partnerships. It raises questions about the nature of creativity and the role of technology in art making.
