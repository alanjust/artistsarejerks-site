## Notable Artwork: VVEBCAM (2007)

VVEBCAM is a series of YouTube videos in which Cortright sits in front of her webcam, seemingly doing nothing in particular, while various visual effects (added using default YouTube tools) and spam comments accumulate on the screen.

### Significance

This work is considered a seminal example of Post-Internet Art. It highlights the aesthetics of early online video, the performativity of online identity, and the blurring of private and public spaces in the digital age. The accumulation of spam comments underscores the commodification of attention online.
