## Notable Artwork: Marilyn (Vanitas) (1977)

This painting is a complex still life filled with symbolic objects, including a photograph of Marilyn Monroe, fruit, candles, jewelry, and makeup. Flack often uses a vanitas theme, referencing the transience of life and beauty.

### Significance

Flack is one of the few prominent female Photorealists. Her work combines the technical precision of Photorealism with a more personal and symbolic approach. Marilyn (Vanitas) explores themes of celebrity, mortality, and the fleeting nature of beauty, using the photographic image as a starting point for a more complex composition.
