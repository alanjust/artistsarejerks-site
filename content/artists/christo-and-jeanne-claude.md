## Notable Artwork: Running Fence (1972-76)

Running Fence was a temporary installation consisting of a 24.5-mile-long, 18-foot-high fabric fence that ran across the hills of Sonoma and Marin Counties in California, eventually extending into the Pacific Ocean.

### Significance

Christo and Jeanne-Claude are known for their large-scale, temporary environmental works. Running Fence was a visually striking intervention in the landscape, highlighting its contours and creating a sense of ephemeral beauty. The project also involved extensive community engagement and navigating complex bureaucratic processes, which became part of the artwork itself.
