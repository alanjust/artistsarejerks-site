## Notable Artwork: The Butcher's Son (2018)

Created with artificial neural networks, this artwork is notable for its innovative use of AI to generate continuously morphing, surreal portraits. The AI creates an endless stream of unique faces, merging and transforming in a dreamlike, almost unsettling flow.

### Significance

The Butcher's Son explores the limits and potential of AI in generating unexpected and aesthetically challenging visual outputs. The artwork addresses the idea of AI as a creative collaborator capable of producing outputs that can intrigue, disturb, and provoke thought about the nature of human likeness and identity as seen through the "eyes" of a machine.
