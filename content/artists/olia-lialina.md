## Notable Artwork: My Boyfriend Came Back From The War (1996)

This is an early and influential work of net art, presented as a black-and-white, hypertext narrative. The user clicks on different words and phrases to navigate through a fragmented story about a couple's reunion after a war.

### Significance

My Boyfriend Came Back From The War is a seminal example of net art, using the unique properties of the web (hyperlinks, interactivity) to create a non-linear, participatory narrative. It explores themes of memory, trauma, and communication in the digital age. It helped define the aesthetics and possibilities of early internet art.
