## Notable Artwork: Lorna (1979-1984)

Lorna is an interactive video installation that allows viewers to explore the life of a fictional agoraphobic woman named Lorna through a laserdisc player and a remote control. The viewer can navigate through Lorna's apartment, access her diary, and make choices that affect the narrative.

### Significance

Lorna is a pioneering work of interactive art, exploring themes of isolation, voyeurism, and the construction of identity in the media age. It anticipates many of the interactive features of later digital media and raises questions about the relationship between the viewer and the artwork.
