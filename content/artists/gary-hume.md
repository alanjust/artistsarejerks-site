## Notable Artwork: Doors series (various)

Hume is best known for his paintings on aluminum panels using high-gloss household paint. The Doors series features simplified, stylized representations of hospital doors, rendered in bold colors and flat, graphic shapes.

### Significance

Hume's work combines elements of Pop Art and Minimalism. The Doors series, while seemingly simple, evokes a sense of institutional anonymity and the sterile environment of hospitals. His use of high-gloss paint creates a seductive, almost artificial surface, reflecting his interest in the aesthetics of consumer culture.
