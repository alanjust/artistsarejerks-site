## About Bruce Nauman

Born: December 6, 1941, Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA Nationality: American Style: Postminimalism, Conceptual Art, Performance Art Influences: Samuel Beckett, Ludwig Wittgenstein, existentialism Major Exhibitions: "Slow Angle Walk (Beckett Walk)" (1968), "The True Artist Helps the World by Revealing Mystic Truths" (1967), "Live Taped Video Corridor" (1970) Quote: "Art is a way of thinking, a way of living."

## Notable Artwork: Slow Angle Walk (Beckett Walk) (1968)

This is a performance and video work in which Nauman walks slowly and deliberately along a narrow corridor, contorting his body at awkward angles. The work is repetitive, disorienting, and explores the limits of the body and perception.

### Significance

Nauman's work often uses his own body as a medium, exploring themes of space, time, movement, and language. Slow Angle Walk exemplifies Postminimalism's interest in process, the body, and the exploration of physical and psychological boundaries. It also draws on the influence of Samuel Beckett's minimalist and absurdist writing.
