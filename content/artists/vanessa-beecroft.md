## Notable Artwork: VB35 (1998)

This performance (and others in her VB series) featured a group of models, often nude or wearing identical clothing, standing or sitting in a gallery space for an extended period. The models were instructed not to interact with the audience, creating a sense of distance and objectification.

### Significance

While sometimes debated as fitting neatly within Relational Aesthetics, Beecroft's performances create a specific social situation and explore themes of the body, identity, and the gaze. The interactions (or lack thereof) between the models and the audience are central to the work, creating a tension between spectacle and alienation. The work raises questions about the performance of femininity and the commodification of the body.
