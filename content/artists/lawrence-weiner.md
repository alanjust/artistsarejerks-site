## About Lawrence Weiner

Born: February 10, 1942, New York City, USA Nationality: American Style: Conceptual Art Influences: Language theory, poetry, public space Major Exhibitions: "A Removal of the Corner of a Rug in Use" (1968), "Statements" (1968) Quote: "The piece need not be built."

## Notable Artwork: A REMOVAL OF THE CORNER OF A RUG IN USE (1968)

This work (and many of Weiner's works) consists solely of text, presented as a statement or proposition. The text describes an action that could be performed, but the artwork exists as the text itself, whether or not the action is carried out.

### Significance

Weiner's text-based works further dematerialize the art object, reducing it to pure language. They emphasize the idea as the primary component of the artwork and leave the realization (or not) of the action to the viewer/participant.
