## Notable Artwork: Vigil (2002)

Vigil was a performance piece in which Belmore, in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, scrubbed the street, lit candles, and called out the names of missing and murdered Indigenous women. The performance culminated in her nailing her red dress to a telephone pole and tearing it off, leaving it in shreds.

### Significance

This powerful and emotionally charged performance directly addressed the crisis of violence against Indigenous women in Canada. It brought attention to a marginalized community and demanded justice and recognition. Belmore's work often uses her own body to confront issues of colonialism, violence, and social injustice.
