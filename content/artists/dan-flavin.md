## Notable Artwork: the nominal three (to William of Ockham) (1963)

This work consists of three commercially available fluorescent light fixtures arranged vertically on a wall. Flavin used only standard colors and sizes of fluorescent tubes, emphasizing their industrial, readymade nature.

### Significance

Flavin's light installations are central to Minimalism. He dematerialized the art object, using light and space as his primary media. The works are site-specific, interacting with the architecture and creating an immersive environment. They avoid any symbolic or metaphorical meaning, focusing instead on the pure sensory experience of light and color.
