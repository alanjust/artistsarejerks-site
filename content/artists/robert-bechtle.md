## About Robert Bechtle

Born: May 14, 1932, San Francisco, California, USA Nationality: American Style: Photorealism, Influences: Photography, California landscapes, suburban life Major Exhibitions: "'61 Pontiac" (1968-1969), "Alameda Gran Torino" (1974), "Roseville Chrysler" (1971) Quote: "I'm interested in the way photographs transform reality."

## Notable Artwork: 61 Pontiac (1968-1969)

A meticulously rendered painting of Bechtle's family standing in front of their 1961 Pontiac station wagon, parked on a suburban street. The image is based on a photograph, and the painting captures the light, shadows, and details of the scene with remarkable accuracy.

### Significance

The painting's focus on an ordinary, almost banal subject—a family and their car—is typical of Bechtle's work and of Photorealism in general. The movement sought to elevate the everyday to the level of art, finding beauty and interest in the mundane. The technical skill required to achieve this level of photographic realism is also a key aspect of the work's significance.
