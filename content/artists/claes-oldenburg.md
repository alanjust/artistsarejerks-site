## About Claes Oldenburg

Born: January 28, 1929, Stockholm, Sweden Died: July 18, 2022, New York City, USA Nationality: Swedish-American Style: Pop Art, Sculpture Influences: Everyday objects, consumer culture, urban environments Major Exhibitions: "The Store" (1961), "Floor Burger" (1962), "Giant Soft Fan" (1966) Quote: "I am for an art that is political-erotical-mystical, that does something other than sit on its ass in a museum."

## Notable Artwork: Floor Burger (1962)

This large-scale sculpture depicts a giant hamburger, made of canvas and filled with foam rubber and cardboard boxes. The sculpture is soft and somewhat droopy, contrasting with the idealized images of food in advertising.

### Significance

Oldenburg's soft sculptures of everyday objects are humorous and subversive. Floor Burger transforms a familiar food item into an unexpected and monumental form, challenging our perceptions of scale and materiality. It comments on consumer culture and the American obsession with food.
