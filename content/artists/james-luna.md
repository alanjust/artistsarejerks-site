## Notable Artwork: The Artifact Piece (1987/1990)

In this performance/installation, Luna placed himself on display in a museum case, labeled as a living artifact. He included personal objects and labels describing his scars and other physical features.

### Significance

The Artifact Piece is a powerful critique of the ways in which Indigenous peoples have been historically represented (and misrepresented) in museums and anthropological displays. Luna's work directly confronts the objectification and exoticization of Indigenous bodies and cultures, reclaiming agency and challenging viewers to reconsider their assumptions.
