## Notable Artwork: Excellences & Perfections (2014)

Excellences &amp; Perfections was a four-month-long performance conducted entirely on Instagram. Ulman crafted a fictional persona, undergoing a staged transformation from "cute girl" to "sugar baby" to "life goddess," posting images and captions that reflected these different stages.

### Significance

This work is a landmark example of performance art in the age of social media. It blurred the lines between reality and fiction, raising questions about authenticity, identity construction, and the curated nature of online self-presentation. It also critiqued the performance of femininity online.
