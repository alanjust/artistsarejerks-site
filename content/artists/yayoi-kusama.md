## Notable Artwork: Infinity Mirrored Room - The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away (2013) (and her Infinity Mirror Rooms series generally)

This work is a room-sized installation lined with mirrors, creating an illusion of infinite space. Hundreds of small, multicolored LED lights are suspended from the ceiling, flickering and reflecting in the mirrors to create a dazzling, immersive environment.

### Significance

Kusama's Infinity Mirror Rooms are among the most popular and widely recognized works of contemporary art. They create a sense of wonder and disorientation, immersing the viewer in a seemingly boundless space. The works explore themes of infinity, self-obliteration, and the interconnectedness of all things.
