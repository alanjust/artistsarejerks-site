## Notable Artwork: The Daddies (2016)

The Daddies is a large-scale painting that reimagines a historical scene, Robert Harris's Fathers of Confederation, with Monkman's alter ego, Miss Chief Eagle Testickle, a glamorous, two-spirit figure, at the center. The painting is filled with Indigenous and European figures, challenging colonial narratives and power structures.

### Significance

Monkman's work is known for its subversive humor, its appropriation of Western art historical styles, and its centering of Indigenous perspectives. The Daddies directly confronts Canada's colonial history and reclaims Indigenous presence and agency within that narrative.
