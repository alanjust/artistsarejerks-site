## About Donald Judd

Born: June 3, 1928, Excelsior Springs, Missouri, USA Died: February 12, 1994, New York City, USA Nationality: American Style: Minimalism, Sculpture Influences: Industrial materials, geometry, space Major Exhibitions: "Untitled (Stack)" series (1960s-1990s), "Specific Objects" (1965) Quote: "A shape, a volume, a color, a surface is something itself. It shouldn't be concealed as part of a fairly different whole."

## Notable Artwork: Untitled (Stack) (1967)

Untitled (Stack) is a vertical series of identical, evenly spaced, cantilevered boxes made of galvanized iron or other industrial materials. The work emphasizes the physical presence of the object, its relationship to the surrounding space, and the serial repetition of form.

### Significance

Judd's "stacks" are iconic examples of Minimalist sculpture. They reject traditional notions of composition, craftsmanship, and artistic expression, focusing instead on the object's "specific" qualities (material, form, color). He aimed to create works that were self-referential and devoid of metaphorical meaning.
