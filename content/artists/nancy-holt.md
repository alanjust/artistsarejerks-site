## Notable Artwork: Sun Tunnels (1973-76)

Sun Tunnels consists of four large concrete cylinders arranged in an open X configuration in the Great Basin Desert in Utah. The tunnels are aligned with the rising and setting sun on the solstices and equinoxes, and they are pierced with holes that cast patterns of light inside.

### Significance

Sun Tunnels is a work that connects the viewer to the cosmos and the cycles of time. It frames the landscape and creates a unique perceptual experience, emphasizing the interplay of light, shadow, and space. Holt's work often explores perception and the relationship between humans and the environment.
