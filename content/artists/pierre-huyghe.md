## Notable Artwork: Untilled (Liegender Frauenakt) (2012)

This work, created for documenta 13, featured a reclining nude sculpture with a beehive for a head, placed in a compost heap in a park. The work also included a dog with a pink leg. The installation created a self-contained ecosystem, evolving over time.

### Significance

Huyghe's work often involves creating complex, living systems that blur the boundaries between nature and culture. Untilled is a powerful example of his interest in creating situations that unfold over time, involving non-human actors (bees, dog) and challenging the traditional notion of the artwork as a static object.
