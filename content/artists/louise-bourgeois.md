## Notable Artwork: Maman (1999)

Maman is a massive bronze sculpture of a spider, over 30 feet tall. The spider carries a sac containing marble eggs, suggesting themes of motherhood, protection, and fear.

### Significance

While Maman is a sculpture, its scale and the way it dominates the space in which it is installed make it a powerful example of installation art. Bourgeois's work often explores themes of family, sexuality, and the subconscious. The spider, a recurring motif in her work, is a complex and ambivalent symbol, representing both a nurturing mother and a fearsome predator. Its imposing size and presence evoke a sense of awe and unease.
