# Attention Lab

## Training Attention as a Radical Act

In a world designed to grab and monetize your attention, the ability to look deeply becomes a form of resistance.

### The Attention Crisis

**Why This Matters**
- Average museum visit: 27 seconds per artwork
- Average phone check: every 12 minutes  
- The designed distraction of modern life
- Attention as the new currency

**What We've Lost**
- The capacity for sustained focus
- Comfort with uncertainty and slowness
- Direct experience vs. mediated consumption
- The space between stimulus and response

### Experimental Exercises

**Slow Looking Labs**
- 10-minute single-artwork sessions
- Progressive timing challenges
- Guided attention techniques
- Meditation meets art appreciation

**Perception Experiments** 
- Visual illusion workshops
- Color and form sensitivity training
- Pattern recognition games
- Peripheral vision exercises

**Distraction Resistance**
- Phone-free art viewing challenges
- Museum mindfulness practices
- "Analog looking" techniques
- Building tolerance for boredom

**Memory & Reflection**
- Recall exercises after viewing
- Comparative memory tests
- Drawing from memory challenges
- Reflection journaling methods

### Digital Detox Tools

**Attention Trackers**
- Self-monitoring apps and techniques
- Progress measurement tools
- Attention span building exercises
- Focus recovery protocols

**Analog Alternatives**
- Paper-based viewing guides
- Sketch-based note-taking systems
- Physical timers and prompts
- Tech-free art experiences

### Research & Data

**Personal Metrics**
- Track your attention span improvement
- Document preference changes over time
- Monitor distraction patterns
- Measure viewing satisfaction

**Community Data**
- Anonymous participation in attention studies
- Crowd-sourced looking experiments
- Collective attention span challenges
- Group slow-looking events

### Advanced Practices

**Artist-Level Seeing**
- How professional artists look at art
- Technical analysis techniques
- Material and process investigation
- Historical context integration

**Curatorial Thinking**
- Comparative viewing exercises  
- Thematic connection building
- Exhibition planning simulations
- Critical evaluation frameworks

**Coming Soon:**
- Interactive attention training games
- Biometric feedback experiments
- VR slow-looking environments
- Attention span challenge leaderboards
- Research collaboration opportunities
